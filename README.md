# 🐍 Python Overview

## 🔁 Python REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)
- Open the terminal and type `python3` to enter the Python shell.
- The shell works as a calculator — you can execute Python expressions directly.

## ⚡ Features of Python

### 🧩 Easy to Learn and Use
- Simple syntax, readable like English.

### ⚙️ Interpreted Language
- No need to compile code; executed line by line.

### 🔠 Dynamically Typed
- No need to declare variable types (e.g., `x = 10`).

### 💡 High-Level Language
- Focuses on simplicity and abstraction (handles memory management automatically).

### 💻 Cross-Platform
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

### 🧱 Object-Oriented
- Supports **classes**, **objects**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.

### 📚 Rich Standard Library
- Includes built-in modules like `math`, `datetime`, and file I/O.

### 🧩 Extensive Third-Party Libraries
- Support for web, ML, data, automation, games, etc. (e.g., **NumPy**, **Django**, **TensorFlow**).

### 🔗 Embeddable and Extensible
- Python can be embedded in or extended by other languages (like C/C++).

### 🌍 Portable
- Python programs run the same across different OS platforms.

### 🔀 Integrated with Other Languages
- Interacts with **Java**, **.NET**, **C**, **C++**, etc.

### 💫 Multiple Programming Paradigms
- Supports **Object-Oriented**, **Functional**, **Procedural**, and **Imperative** paradigms.

### 🧹 Garbage Collection
- Automatic memory management via garbage collector.

### 💬 Interactive Mode Support (REPL)
- Test and debug code quickly in the Python shell.

### 🌐 Used in Diverse Domains
- Web Development, Data Science, Automation, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, and more.

## 🧮 Variables
- A Python variable is **created automatically** when you assign a value to it.
# DataTypes
1. Numeric Data Types
   - int
   - flot
   - complex
2. String Data Types
3. Sequence Data Types
   - list (similar to arrays but it contains different data type and enclosed in square brackets, their elements and size can be changed)
   - tuple (similar to list and enclosed in small brackets, their elements and size can't be changed it means read-only lists).
   - range (Syntax: range(start, stop, step))
4. Binary Data Types
   - bytes
   - bytearray
   - memoryview
5. Dictionary Data Type
6. Set Data Type
   - set (A set in Python is a collection, but is not an indexed or ordered collection as string, list or tuple. An object cannot appear more than once in a set, whereas in List and Tuple, same object can appear more than once.Comma separated items in a set are put inside curly brackets or braces {}. Items in the set collection can be of different data types.)
   - frozenset
7. Boolean Data Type
8. None Type

# Type casting
1. A type casting refers to converting an object of one type into another.
2. Python supports two types of casting − implicit and explicit.

# List Data type features
- enclosed in square brackets.
- Python lists may have objects of different data types.
- A Python list is mutable
- One or more objects from the list can be removed or added.
- A list may have same item at more than one index positions.

# Tuple Data type features
- enclosed in parentheses ().
- tuple may have objects of different data types.
- tuple is immutable.
- cannot be modified, removed or added.
